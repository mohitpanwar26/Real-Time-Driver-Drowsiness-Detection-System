# SOC_Project
Summer of code project on "Real Time Driver Drowsiness Detection System"

## Week 1

Learned the basic concepts of python from w3schools.com

Learned advanced python concepts in python from GeeksForGeeks like map function, lambda function,Exception Handling, itertools, decorators, collectors, generators etc

Learned about object oriened programming in python

Solved problems in python

## Week 2

Learned about Machine Learning (Supervised learning mainly) from video lectues of Andrew NG

Learned about linear regression with one variable, cost function, gradient descent and similiarly linear regression with multiple variables

Learned about logistic regression(classification), decision boundary, cost function of logistic regression(loss function), optimization and multiclass classification

Learned about problem of overfitting and need of regularization, Regularized linear regression
Regularized logistic regression

Learned about pandas, numpy and matplotlib basics

Learned some mathematical concepts in ML

## Week 3

Got an overview about Deep Learning through video lectures from freecodecamp

Learned about CNN architecture through video lectures of Andrew NG

Learned about Tenserflow and Keras

Peroformed a mini project of MNIST data classification

## Week 4

Started with the coding part. 

Read a paper on MobileNet model and understand it

Learned about CNN through further video lectures of Andrew NG

## Week 5



## Week 6

Took live video as input from webcam for prediction of closed eyes

At first the face cascade and eye cascade models are loaded to detect face and eyes from the live video input through webcam

Then a rectangle box gets created around face and inside that, box for both eyes are also created

After which cbs parameter is set to 1 if eyes are detected otherwise 0

If cbs is 1 then eyes are cropped and prediction is done using model whether eyes are closed or open and will get displayed on the window frame

press q to exit out of the window
